<h3>
Metabolism</h3>
<br>
With the exception of insects, hummingbirds while in flight have the highest metabolism of all animals – a necessity to support the rapid beating of their wings during hovering and fast forward flight.[3][34] Their heart rate can reach as high as 1,260 beats per minute, a rate once measured in a blue-throated hummingbird, with a breathing rate of 250 breaths per minute, even at rest.[35][36] During flight, oxygen consumption per gram of muscle tissue in a hummingbird is about 10 times higher than that measured in elite human athletes.[3]

Hummingbirds are rare among vertebrates in their ability to rapidly make use of ingested sugars to fuel energetically expensive hovering flight,[37] powering up to 100% of their metabolic needs with the sugars they drink (in comparison, human athletes max out at around 30%). Hummingbirds can use newly ingested sugars to fuel hovering flight within 30–45 minutes of consumption.[38][39] These data suggest that hummingbirds are able to oxidize sugar in flight muscles at rates high enough to satisfy their extreme metabolic demands. By relying on newly ingested sugars to fuel flight, hummingbirds can reserve their limited fat stores to sustain their overnight fasting or to power migratory flights.[38]

Studies of hummingbirds' metabolisms are relevant to the question of how a migrating ruby-throated hummingbird can cross 800 km (500 mi) of the Gulf of Mexico on a nonstop flight.[36] This hummingbird, like other birds preparing to migrate, stores fat as a fuel reserve, thereby augmenting its weight by as much as 100%, hence increasing potential flying time over open water.[36][40]

<h3>Kidney function</h3><br>
The dynamic range of metabolic rates in hummingbirds[41] requires a parallel dynamic range in kidney function.[42] During a day of nectar consumption with corresponding high water intake that may total five times the body weight per day, hummingbird kidneys process water via glomerular filtration rates (GFR) in amounts proportional to water consumption, thereby avoiding overhydration.[42][43] During brief periods of water deprivation, however, such as in nighttime torpor, GFR ceases, preserving body water.[42][43]

Hummingbird kidneys also have a unique ability to control the levels of electrolytes after consuming nectars with high amounts of sodium and chloride or none, indicating that kidney and glomerular structures must be highly specialized for variations in nectar mineral quality.[44] Morphological studies on Anna's hummingbird kidneys showed adaptations of high capillary density in close proximity to nephrons, allowing for precise regulation of water and electrolytes.[43][45]

<h3>Flight stability</h3><br>
During turbulent airflow conditions created experimentally in a wind tunnel, hummingbirds exhibit stable head positions and orientation when they hover at a feeder.[46] When wind gusts from the side, hummingbirds compensate by increasing wing-stroke amplitude and stroke plane angle, and by varying these parameters asymmetrically between the wings and from one stroke to the next.[46] They also vary the orientation and enlarge the collective surface area of their tail feathers into the shape of a fan.[46] While hovering, the visual system of a hummingbird is able to separate apparent motion caused by the movement of the hummingbird itself from motions caused by external sources, such as an approaching predator.[33] In natural settings full of highly complex background motion, hummingbirds are able to precisely hover in place by rapid coordination of vision with body position.[33]

<h3>Song and vocal learning</h3><br>
Consisting of chirps, squeaks, whistles and buzzes,[47] hummingbird songs originate from at least seven specialized nuclei in the forebrain.[48][49] In a genetic expression study, it was shown that these nuclei enable vocal learning (ability to acquire vocalizations through imitation), a rare trait known to occur in only two other groups of birds (parrots and songbirds) and a few groups of mammals (including humans, whales and dolphins and bats).[48] Within the past 66 million years, only hummingbirds, parrots and songbirds out of 23 bird orders may have independently evolved seven similar forebrain structures for singing and vocal learning, indicating that evolution of these structures is under strong epigenetic constraints possibly derived from a common ancestor.[48][50]

The blue-throated hummingbird’s song differs from typical oscine songs in its wide frequency range, extending from 1.8 kHz to approximately 30 kHz.[51] It also produces ultrasonic vocalizations which do not function in communication.[51] As blue-throated hummingbirds often alternate singing with catching small ﬂying insects, it is possible the ultrasonic clicks produced during singing disrupt insect ﬂight patterns, making insects more vulnerable to predation.[51]

<h3>Torpor</h3><br>
The metabolism of hummingbirds can slow at night or at any time when food is not readily available: the birds enter a hibernation-like, deep-sleep state (known as torpor) to prevent energy reserves from falling to a critical level. During night-time torpor, body temperature falls from 40 to 18 °C,[52] with heart and breathing rates both slowed dramatically (heart rate to roughly 50 to 180 beats per minute from its daytime rate of higher than 1000).[53]

During torpor, to prevent dehydration, the GFR ceases, preserving needed compounds such as glucose, water, and nutrients.[42] Further, body mass declines throughout nocturnal torpor at a rate of 0.04 g per hour, amounting to about 10% of weight loss each night.[42] The circulating hormone, corticosterone, is one signal that arouses a hummingbird from torpor.[54]

Use and duration of torpor vary among hummingbird species and are affected by whether a dominant bird defends territory, with nonterritorial subordinate birds having longer periods of torpor.[55]
<h3>
Lifespan</h3><br>
Hummingbirds have long lifespans for organisms with such rapid metabolisms. Though many die during their first year of life, especially in the vulnerable period between hatching and fledging, those that survive may occasionally live a decade or more.[56] Among the better-known North American species, the average lifespan is probably 3 to 5 years.[56] For comparison, the smaller shrews, among the smallest of all mammals, seldom live longer than 2 years.[57] The longest recorded lifespan in the wild relates to a female broad-tailed hummingbird that was banded (ringed) as an adult at least one year old, then recaptured 11 years later, making her at least 12 years old.[citation needed] Other longevity records for banded hummingbirds include an estimated minimum age of 10 years 1 month for a female black-chinned hummingbird similar in size to the broad-tailed hummingbird, and at least 11 years 2 months for a much larger buff-bellied hummingbird.[58]
<h3>
Reproduction</h3><br>
As far as is known, male hummingbirds do not take part in nesting.[59] Most species build a cup-shaped nest on the branch of a tree or shrub,[60] although a few tropical species normally attach their nests to leaves.[citation needed] The nest varies in size relative to the particular species – from smaller than half a walnut shell to several centimeters in diameter.[59][61]

Many hummingbird species use spider silk and lichen to bind the nest material together and secure the structure.[60][62] The unique properties of the silk allow the nest to expand as the young hummingbirds grow.[60][61] Two white eggs are laid,[60][62] which despite being the smallest of all bird eggs, are in fact large relative to the adult hummingbird's size.[61] Incubation lasts 14 to 23 days,[62] depending on the species, ambient temperature, and female attentiveness to the nest.[59] The mother feeds her nestlings on small arthropods and nectar by inserting her bill into the open mouth of a nestling, and then regurgitating the food into its crop.[59][61]

<h3>Feather colors</h3>

To serve courtship and territorial competition, many male hummingbirds have plumage with bright, varied coloration[63] resulting both from pigmentation in the feathers and from prism-like cells within the top layers of feathers of the head, gorget, breast, back and wings.[64] When sunlight hits these cells, it is split into wavelengths that reflect to the observer in varying degrees of intensity,[64] with the feather structure acting as a diffraction grating.[64] Iridescent hummingbird colors result from a combination of refraction and pigmentation, since the diffraction structures themselves are made of melanin, a pigment,[63] and may also be colored by carotenoid pigmentation and more subdued black, brown or gray colors dependent on melanin.[64]

By merely shifting position, feather regions of a muted-looking bird can instantly become fiery red or vivid green.[64] In courtship displays for one example, males of the colorful Anna's hummingbird orient their bodies and feathers toward the sun to enhance the display value of iridescent plumage toward a female of interest.[65]

One study of Anna's hummingbirds found that dietary protein was an influential factor in feather color, as birds receiving more protein grew significantly more colorful crown feathers than those fed a low-protein diet.[66] Additionally, birds on a high-protein diet grew yellower (higher hue) green tail feathers than birds on a low-protein diet.[66]
